This is a fitness tracker application for Android Marshmallow and above for our Senior Project. It counts steps, calories lost, and distance in one home page. You can change your height and weight to reflect those different values as well. There is also a notifier to notify your when you haven't taken a step for more than an hour and a half. There is also a notification listener when you are near NYIT of Old Westbury and going a certain speed to park farther away.
