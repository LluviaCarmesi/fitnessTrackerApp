This is the real project. Please pull this code and try to implement the database into this project. Also, help me figure out some things in terms of implementing the Google Maps API and the Notification API as well. Thank you. Also, when you want to push new code into this repository, update this readme file with any changes that you made.

Update #2: I just added some comments and made the launch icon for the app.

Update #3: I added the funcionality to make the notification appear when the user hasn't walked for an hour, however for some reason it comes up silently and isn't noticeable to the user. No sound was added either. Color to the notification also needs to be added.
